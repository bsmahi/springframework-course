# What is an API?
An API, short for Application Programming Interface, serves as a framework of regulations and standards enabling various software applications to interact with one another.
APIs establish the procedures and data structures that applications can employ to solicit and share data.

# What is REST?
REST is short for **Re**presentational **S**tate **T**ransfer, an architectural style commonly used in designing networked applications.
RESTful systems usually **employ HTTP as the communication protocol** and adhere to a specific set of principles when developing web services.

# What is a RESTful API?
A RESTful API is an API that follows the principles of REST. It provides a way for software applications to interact with each other over the internet using standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
RESTful APIs are designed to be simple, scalable, and easy to understand.

# Key Concepts of RESTful APIs:

**Resources:** In a RESTful API, **all entities are regarded as resources**. A resource refers to any data that can be retrieved or modified.
Each resource is distinguished by a distinct **URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)** that is utilized for accessing it.

**HTTP Methods:** RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods to perform operations on resources. The most common HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs are:

**GET:** Retrieve a resource

**POST:** Create a new resource

**PUT:** Update an existing resource

**DELETE:** Delete a resource

**Uniform Interface:** RESTful APIs provide a standardized interface, ensuring that developers can easily comprehend and utilize the API. 
This uniformity is achieved by employing a consistent **set of HTTP methods and URI patterns across all resources**, simplifying the development process.

**Statelessness:** RESTful APIs are stateless, meaning that each request from a client to the server must contain all the information necessary to understand the request. 
The server does not store any state about the client session between requests.

**Representation:** Resources in a RESTful API are represented in a standard format, such as JSON or XML. Clients can request different representations of a resource using content negotiation.

**Example:**
Let's say you're building a blog application with a RESTful API. You might have resources like posts, comments, and users. Each resource would have its own URI, and you would use HTTP methods to perform operations on those resources. For example:

> [!IMPORTANT]

- GET /posts: Retrieve a list of all blog posts
- POST /posts: Create a new blog post
- GET /posts/{id}: Retrieve a specific blog post by its ID
- PUT /posts/{id}: Update an existing blog post
- DELETE /posts/{id}: Delete a blog post
  
By following these principles, you can design and implement RESTful APIs that are easy to understand, use, and maintain.
